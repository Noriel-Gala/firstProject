## This is my first personal project ever so do not expect anything crazy
## A little about me:
- I'm a computer engineering major in my 2nd semester entering 3rd
- I'm doing this project first and forward to make a game I find fun.
- I've only been coding for less than a year consistently inconsistent
- Only coding languages I've had experience with are Python, C, and a little bit of C++

## What led me to make this game:
- I've played many roblox incremental games so I've decided to try my hand at making my own outside of roblox
- There was one specific game where the developer had made the games about a year or two ago on his own website through github/git
- If I find his account again I'll be sure to link it below this so I can give credit because he inspired me to make my own incremental game

## Installation (working on making this better)
- Clone this repo
- Run the game with 'python incremental.py' or whatever you use

## How to Play:
- Enter `1` to click.
- Enter `2` to upgrade clicking power.
- Enter `3` to upgrade auto-resources.
- Enter `q` to quit game and save.
- The goal is reach the "Beyond"

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
