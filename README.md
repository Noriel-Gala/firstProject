This is my first personal project ever so do not expect anything crazy
A little about me:
- I'm a computer engineering major in my 2nd semester entering 3rd
- I'm doing this project first and forward to make a game I find fun.
- I've only been coding for less than a year consistently inconsistent
- Only coding languages I've had experience with are Python, C, and a little bit of C++
Thank you for reading this and leave any criticism, comments, or concerns on the repo page thank you.
