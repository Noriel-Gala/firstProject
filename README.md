## This is my first personal project ever so do not expect anything crazy
## A little about me:
- I'm a computer engineering major in my 2nd semester entering 3rd
- I'm doing this project first and forward to make a game I find fun.
- I've only been coding for less than a year consistently inconsistent
- Only coding languages I've had experience with are Python, C, and a little bit of C++

## What led me to make this game:
- I've played many roblox incremental games so I've decided to try my hand at making my own outside of roblox
- There was one specific game where the developer had made the games about a year or two ago on his own website through github/git
- If I find his account again I'll be sure to link it below this so I can give credit because he inspired me to make my own incremental game
- name@github

## How to download:
- Step one; Click on the .exe file (once game is made obviously)
- Step two; Enjoy!
- Step three; Enjoy some more!
- Step four; Repeat the cycle until everyone is infected!

## How to Play:
- Press `c` to collect resources.
- Press `u` to spend resources and upgrade.
- The goal is to collect as many upgrades as possible!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation (working on making this better)
- Clone this repo
- Run the game with 'python incremental.py'

NOTE: THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING GIT/CREATING MY OWN REPO/FIRST TIME EVERYTHING I AM VERY NEW TO THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
